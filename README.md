# ETL-Project

For our project, we will be performing an analysis of Netflix content. We found our two data sets from Kaggle, listed below:<br>
Netflix Shows- https://www.kaggle.com/chasewillden/netflix-shows?select=Netflix+Shows.csv<br>
Netflix Titles- https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows<br> 


Introduction:<br>
Both datasets are CSV files. The general transformation for both of these datasets will require dropping unnecessary columns, removing NULL values, sorting tables, checking and removing duplicates, and fixing the layout of some rows. The final result includes two separate SQL tables but the two tables do not have a Foreign Key. We chose SQL because we thought it would provide an easy way of viewing and analyzing the data for an analyst.
